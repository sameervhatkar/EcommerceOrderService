# E-commerce Order Microservice

# Overview

This microservice handles order management within the e-commerce platform. It provides endpoints for creating, viewing, and updating orders, as well as managing order items. Additionally, this microservice communicates with other services such as User, Product, and Payment to validate the user, check product availability, and process payments. The Order Microservice is critical for maintaining order records and ensuring smooth e-commerce transactions.
